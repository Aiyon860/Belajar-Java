# Abstract Collection

// Definiton //
Data Structure of Collection in Java always evolved, but usually the base algorithm is always same between Collection type/kind.
Almost all of the Interface Collection in Java already have its Abstract Class as a fundamental/groundwork of the Algorithm, and almost all of the concrete class implementation always extends Abstract Class collection. 
This thing ease us when we want to make manual Collection, we don't have to make the collection from beginning, but we can use the Abstract class that has been provided instead.
