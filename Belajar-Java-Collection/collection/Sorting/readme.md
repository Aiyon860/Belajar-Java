# Sorting

// Definiton //
Sorting (or 'Pengurutan') is the algorithm that we already used to do in our daily coding routine.
Also, in Java Collection already provide a way/method to do sorting. So, we don't have to sorting manually.
But, there is a thing to remember. That the Sorting is can be used ONLY in List. Because Set, Queue, Deque, and Map already have their own specific workflow for sorting process.

// Other //
! To do Sorting, we must ensure that the List is mutable. Because we want to manipulate the data (the order) !
