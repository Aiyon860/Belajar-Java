# Binary Search (will deeping this topic in the near future)

// Definiton //
By default, List in Java has 'search' feature or 'get data'. But, the implementation is by using Sequential search, means that the data will be checked/verified one by one from the beginning to the end.
One of the popular searching algorithms is Binary search. However, binary search only can be done if the data has been sorted in ordered way.
Luckily, in Java Collection there is already the implementation of Binary search. So that we don't have to build it manually.
