# Collection Interface

// Defintion //
Aside from 'Iterable' interface, parent class for all collection in Java is named 'Collection'.
For 'Iterable' interface, it is used as contract to do iteration data sequentially.
'Collection' interface is contract to manipulate 'collection' data, such as: add, remove, check the content of 'collection' data and etc.
There is no direct implementation for Collection, because collection later will be divided into List, Set, and Queue.
