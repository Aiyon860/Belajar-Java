# Queue Interface

// Definition //
Queue is the implementation from Data Structure 'Queue' (or in Bahasa Indonesia: 'Antrian') or FIFO (First In First Out).

// ArrayDeque vs LinkedList vs PriorityQueue //
1. ArrayDeque using Array as implementation of its Queue.
2. LinkedList using Double Linked List as implementation of its Queue.
3. PriorityQueue using Array as implementation of its Queue, BUT sorted (ascending) by using Comparable or Comparator.

// Pre-Caution //
When using add(), remove(), and element(). It will generate Exception.
Otherwise, when using offer(), poll(), and peek(). It won't generate Exception and thus will generate 'null'.
