we know that child class only has 1 parent class
but in interface, a child class can have more than 1 interface
even interface can implement other interface, capable of more than 1. ---> multiple interface inheritance

But if we want to inherit interface from other interface, we use "extends" not "implements"
(little bit inconsistent haha)

Primary note:
class ---> interface = implements
interface ---> interface = extends
