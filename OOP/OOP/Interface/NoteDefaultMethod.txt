Default Method is used in interface since Java 8, because as we have learned before (cont)
that in interface we cannot make concrete method.

It will be hard to maintain the contract between interface and the inheritance (or implement) of the interface (child class),
because when you add (abstract) method inside of the interface, it will force all the child class to re-declare or override
the method that been defined in the interface ------> therefore, this is why default method is implemented.

by using Default Method, we can add concrete method inside the interface.
