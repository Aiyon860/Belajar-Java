----------------------------------> toString Method <----------------------------------

toString() is a method that belong to the Object class (mother of all class).
this method is used to represent the object as String method.

by default, toString() will result:
classname + @ + hashCode

but we can change the representation value of the toString method if we want to, 
so that the object that we made can be read more easily when we print out the object.
