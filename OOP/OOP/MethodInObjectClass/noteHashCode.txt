----------------------------------> hashCode Method <----------------------------------

hashCode method is integer representative, same as toString method that represent String.

by using hashCode method we can fetch unique identity of our object.
by default, hashCode will return integer value according to the data in memory. But we can override it it we want to.

//// Contract to override hashCode method ////
1. no matter how many hashCode are called, for the same object, it must result same integer data.
2. if there are 2 objects that are same, if we compare it using equals method, thus the hashCode value must be same too.
3. if equals method result false, the hashCode that DIFFERENT is not obliged (tidak wajib hashCode berbeda), because the limitation of amount of integers are more or less 2 billion (milyar)
