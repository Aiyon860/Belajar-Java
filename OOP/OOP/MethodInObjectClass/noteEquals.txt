----------------------------------> equals Method <----------------------------------

equals(); ----> used for comparing object

on other programming languanges, as to checking whether one object is same to other object,
they usually use "==" operator. But in Java, "==" operator is to checking PRIMITIVE data

for NON-PRIMITIVE data, the way to checking them is by using equals method ---> equals()
if we force using "==" in non-primitive data, that's not comparing the object, but comparing the object position on memory 
are whether same or not.

and by default, equals method will compare 2 objects in term of similarity of object position on memory.
means that if we make 2 objects with the same field content, will still considered "Different" by the equals method.

thus, it is better to override the equals method that belongs to Object class (mother of all classes).

"==" is used for checking whether the method is same or not in the memory.
by using equals(), it's checking the content of the string is same or not, not to checking whether the method is same or not.
