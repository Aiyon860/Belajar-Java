----------------------------------> Static Keyword <----------------------------------

// DEFINITION //
by using static we can make field, method, or class that can be access directly without through object.
static can only and only access other static

// Use of Static //
1. Field (class variable). Means that field can be access directly without have to making the object first.
2. Method (class method). ---------- // ----------
3. Block, static block will automatically executed when a class is loaded (dimuat(?)).
   static can only access other static.
4. Inner Class. Means that inner class can be access directly without have to making the object of outer class first. 
   But the drawback is when using static on inner class, we can't access the object of outer class anymore. 

static is seldom to use, but usually used to make helper method.

Extra note:
when we using static we got recommended to using uppercase as to making the variable, ex: APPLICATION
(Still don't know the reason why)

// Static Import //
by put in static on import line, you don't have to put in the name of the class. EX: (look below)

from this:
import StaticKeyword.Constant.*;
System.out.println(Constant.APPLICATION);

to this:
import static StaticKeyword.Constant.*;
System.out.println(APPLICATION);

// intermezzo //
helper method is used in:
1. Provides common methods which are required by multiple classes in the project.
2. Helper methods are generally public and static so that these can be invoked independently.
3. Each methods of a helper class should work independent of other methods of same class.
