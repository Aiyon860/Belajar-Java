----------------------------------> Enum Class <----------------------------------

// DEFINTION //
Enum class is the class that the data inside are value-limited (that already set).
Ex: bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond or reguler, premium, VIP or male and female

By default, enum class will automatically extends java.lang.Enum ;
thus, we cannot extends other class. But we can still implements interface.

// ENUM MEMBERS //
same as class as usual, we can also add members (field, method, constructor) to enum class.

But constructor in particular, we cannot make public constructor.
Because the purpose of enum class is not to be instantiated freely.
and due to this, we can't make object out of enum.
But then we directly use the choices of the enum (like REGULER, SILVER, GOLD that we made just now).

// Conversion //
-> from enum to string <-
Ex: look at line 13 on EnumApp.java

-> from string to enum <-
Ex: look at line 17 on EnumApp.java

-> to check all options in enum class <-
Ex: look at line 24 on EnumApp.java
