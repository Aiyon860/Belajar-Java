----------------------------------> Inner Class <----------------------------------

// DEFINITION //
We can make class in a class, it's called inner class.

one of the cases is when we need to make a few of classes that connected one to each other,
where a class cannot be made without other class.
    ex: we need to make "Employee" class, where we need "Company" class, 
        then we can make "Employee" class as a inner class of "Company".

How to make inner class?
- we can make the inner class inside of block of the outer class.
- we can also set the access modifier to public or private to the both outer and inner class.1

// ACCESS OUTER CLASS //
1. The advantages of making inner class is that the ability to access its outer class.
2. Inner class can read all the PRIVATE member that belong to the outer class.
3. To access object of the outer class, we can use the name of outer class then followed by the "this" keyword. Ex: Company.This
4. To access the super class (parent class) of the outer class, we can use the name of outer class then followed by the "super" keyword. Ex: Company.super
