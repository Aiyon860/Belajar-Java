----------------------------------> Anonymous Class <----------------------------------

// DEFINITION //
Anonymous class = class without name.
is the ability to declare class, also at the same time instantiate the object.
1. Put block {} to the OBJECT to make Anonymous class inside of the object block.

Anonymous class is literally included in inner class, where its outer class is the place we make anonymous class.

Anonymous class is really fit when we have to deal with the case of making interface implementation or
simple and plain abstract class without have to making class implementation. 

// CONS // 
Anonymous class cannot be REUSED.
So, you have to make another anonymous class when you want to instantiate other object.
Thus wasn't same with concrete class when you can reuse it many times as you will.
